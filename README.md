# To-do-List

This Java program is a simple todo list application that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks. It also provides an option to export the tasks to a text file. The program uses an ArrayList to store the tasks and a Scanner for user input. The user is prompted with a menu of options and can choose to perform various actions on their todo list. The exported text file is named after the user's full name, and each task is numbered for easy reference.
